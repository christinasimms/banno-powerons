##Alerts PowerOn Service

The Banno Alert service uses PowerOns to query Episys for transactions that may trigger an alert.  Once a user sets up a share or loan alert, Banno adds the member number plus share or loan ID to the MEMBERDATA.DAT data file. The PowerOns use that list to gather transactions to hand back to Banno. This process runs every 10-15 minutes.  

###PowerOn Name(s)
•	BANNO.ALERT.TRANSACTIONS.V1
•	BANNO.ALERT.TRANSFILE.V1

The BANNO.ALERT.TRANSACTIONS.V1 runs every time Episys is queried.  If the returning transaction count is more than 9500 transactions, then Banno uses BANNO.ALERT.TRANSFILE.V1 repeatedly until all transactions are returned.
